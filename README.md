## Three.js Demo with React and React Three Fiber

Welcome to this demo by [Leandro Reschke](https://github.com/leandroreschke) of [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) integrated within a React application using [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber). This repository showcases simple 3D scenes using a variety of three.js technologies working in harmony.

## Features

- üîµ **Three.js Integration**: Demonstrates the use of Three.js within a React application, highlighting the library's vast 3D capabilities.
- ü™ê **React-Three-Fiber**: Shows how react-three-fiber serves as the bridge between React and Three.js, allowing developers to work with 3D components in a React-friendly way.

## What You'll Learn

By exploring this repository, you'll get a deeper understanding of:

- The basic structure of a React application implementing Three.js.
- How to build and manipulate 3D objects using Three.js within a React environment.
- Leveraging react-three-fiber to incorporate Three.js into React's declarative style.
